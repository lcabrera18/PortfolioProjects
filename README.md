**Data Source:** The housing market data was obtained from [Alex The Analyst repo](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects).  

**Techniques Used:** SQL was used to clean and transform the data, making it suitable for subsequent analysis, such as pricing trends or neighborhood comparisons.

## Project 3: Netflix Data Exploration
**Description:** In this project, I delved into Netflix data to uncover insights about the streaming platform's content library and user preferences. I examined genres, viewer ratings, and regional popularity.  

**Data Source:** The Netflix data was collected from Kaggle.  

**Techniques Used:** SQL queries were employed to aggregate and analyze the data, shedding light on the diversity of content and viewer preferences on the platform.  


Feel free to explore each project's directory for detailed documentation, SQL scripts, and data files. I plan to continue adding more SQL projects to this repository, so stay tuned for updates and new analyses! If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.  

Happy coding and data exploration! üìäüîçüìà
